##Capital Meet-ups,

the final project for Enspiral Dev Academy. The class was segmented into groups, and each group had a week to build a application for presentation. Our group that consisted of Alex, Nat, Arpo, Ranjit and myself worked on differing aspects of the project. At the beginning we assigned the components of the project based on the skills that people were not confident in. Through doing this we were required to focus on Agile based techniques in keeping up with tasks.
